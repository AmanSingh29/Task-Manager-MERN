## Installation & Setup

### Backend Setup
1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Go to the `BE` folder and create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
PORT=7070
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-manager # Use local MongoDB or your cloud MongoDB URL
NODE_ENV=dev
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i -f
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. When the server starts, go to the ports section in the VS Code terminal, forward the port on which the process is running, make it public, and copy the endpoint. This will be used in the frontend.

### Frontend Setup
1. Go to the `FE` folder and create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
VITE_API_URL=<your-backend-endpoint> # Use The copied endpoint from the forwarding port.
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i -f
```

3. Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the provided local URL in your browser to access the app.

## Creating an Admin User

1. First, create a normal user account through the Signup page.
2. Open your MongoDB database (local or cloud) and find the newly created user in the `users` collection.
3. Change the user's role from `user` to `admin` by updating the `role` field:

```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

4. Save the changes in the database.
5. Login with that userâ€™s credentials again. Now the user will have admin access and can view/manage all tasks in the dashboard.

## Notes
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud MongoDB URL.
